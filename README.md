## Overview

### My vision :eyes:

To join the world of web development professionally and share my passion of
all things web. This way I can help create amazing things which can be enjoyed
by other people, whether to help them achieve a goal or just have fun.

### Repo purpose :smiley:

The purpose of this repo is to use these challenges as practice and improve or
gain knowledge about web development. Maybe in the mean time also help other
developers tackling the same challenges and are stuck.

## Solutions

Each solution is separated by the difficulty level and a screenshot of the

## Images in the readme

In case you are curious as to how the images sit next to each other and
they move when they page is resized. I used the [Github flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/#html-blocks).

I added the images with `![alt-text](image-url)` like so.

**Note:** The images can go on separate lines but don't add a space between
them or it will break the layout _unless you want the gap in between_.

```
![alt-text](image-url)
![alt-text](image-url)
```

The image plus some CSS to keep them together. This can go anywhere on the document. The CSS will not be shown on the rendered page.

```CSS
<style type="text/css">
p img {
  display: inline-block;
  min-width: 180px;
  width: 30%;
  margin: 0 auto 3px;
}
</style>
```

<style type="text/css">
p img {
  display: inline-block;
  min-width: 180px;
  width: 30%;
  margin: 0 auto 3px;
}
</style>
